# Portfolio 2.0
Check out my portfolio! https://jessicahuynh19.github.io/portfolio2.0/
## Goal
My goal for this portfolio was freshen it up, and craft together something I'd potentially send to my future employer. I really got to be creative and let the styling gleam my personality. I got to play around and mess with cool features during the process. 

## Proudest Feature
I love the pulsing animation at the bottom, and the gradient coloring of my name.

## What Needs Fixing
I have a menu toggler in the top right corner and it's suppose to have a drop menu that isn't dropping so I'd like to fix that. Most of the website is mobile repsonsive except for the heading with my name so to include that part. I definitely need a good branding statement and to fill in actual statements rather then just lorem text.
